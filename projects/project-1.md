summary: Me and my partner constructed a demo version of a stoplight equipped with sounds unsing an Arduino Uno board, LEDs, wires, a speaker, and some coding.

The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digitalinputs/outputs, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. The device is specifically for beginners who have no coding experience and no circuit experience. This is because the user is able to do a set of tutorial online for free and download the Arduino IDE to code for free.

Me and my partner used this to build a stoplight with sound. The purpose is to demonstrate a spcific situation at a stoplight. What if a blind pedestrian is at a 4 way intersection with a stoplight and wants to cross? On the other hand what if a car is waiting at a stoplight and he is not paying attention to the color on the stoplight? 

Me and my partner came to the conclusion probably adding a speaker with sound that was integrated with the color on the lights would be beneficial to these situations. For example, if the light was green, the speaker would emit a sound that would tell the car its safe to proceed. If the light was red, the soeaker would emit a a high pitched danger sound to tell the car to not go. 

To demonstrate this, we built a small prototype of it on a bredboard. We used three LEDs to symbolize the different stoplight colors and connected them to the Arduino Uno board and a speaker. To make it function, we used the Arduino IDE to code and implement the program into the Arduino Uno.
