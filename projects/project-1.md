Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board that is made specifically for beginners with no prior coding experience and circuit development. Included on the device are 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a reset button, and much more. A USB port is attached to give the user the ability to implement its function using teh Arduino IDE.

In this project, me and my partner developed a mini stoplight with sound in hopes to enlighten some about crosswalk and road safety. This is to ensure pedestrians and drivers are more aware at intersections. The stoplight was made on the bredboard with wires and LEDs to represent the colors on it. The sound function was represented by a little speaker attached to the circuit. We also synchronized the different sounds with the diffferent colors by programming the Arduino Uno with the Arduino IDE.

For this project, we both contributed equally to the overall project. In first half, I programmed the board use the Arduino IDE and my parter did the bredboarding. We also periodically checked each others progress to make sure we were on the same page. In the second half, we decided to switch roles so the project didn't feel repetitive and boring. Through this experience, we learned proper teamwork skills and the ability to adapt to many problems that arise from dealing with circuits. We also learned about how powerful the Arduino is and the possibilities that come with it if you are well experienced in the area.
