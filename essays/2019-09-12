You are on the phone. Your friend tells you meet her at the park. You agree and she tells you she's by the tree. When you get to the park
you realize you cant find her. There's other people there. There are trees and grass everywhere as far as the eye cans see. When you 
contact her, she says the same thing. 

So why couldn't you find her in the park? Was her answer too vague? Too simple? Too confusing? Did she give you enough information to find
her in the first place? Was it the way she told you? The chances are, it was all of it. The communication between you and her was not
good enough. It was not clear at all where she was.

As software engineeers, we encounter problems all the time. If we want help, we need to be able communicate our issue in a way that othes
more experienced will understand, which is referred to as the "smart way". If we follow this guideline, people will likely help you more. 
Sometimes, they may already give you a solution. Let's look at two examples from StackOverflow.

This first example comes from this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57895641/bootstrap-4-text-refuses-to-go-in-the-middle-of-a-div

This shows what happens when you don't ask the "smart way". The title of the post is "Bootstrap 4 - text refuses to go in the middle of a 
div". The first thing I noticed was the question. I wasn't sure what he was trying to ask in the first place and it looks plain lazy. The
second thing is the description of his problem. It is very unorganized and confusing. It took me some to realze what he wanted to do. The 
last thing I noticed is the response. Only one person tried to help him and it didn't look like a promising response.

The second example comes from this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42283011/add-validation-to-a-mediatr-behavior-pipeline

This shows a "smart way" of asking. The title of this post is "Add validation to a MediatR behavior pipeline?". Unlike the last post, the
user is much more clear in describing the problem. First thing to note is the title. The question is gives us a clear image on what the 
problem is gonna deal with without even reading the post. Second, he desrcibes his situation clearly. He tells us what he is using and 
what he wants to accomplish with it. He also provides code in such a well organized matter. Finally, the most important thing to note is 
the response he got. Because of how well the user was able to explain his situation, another person was able to give him a step-by-step
solution to his problemm
