You are on the phone. Your friend tells you to meet her at the park. You agree and she tells you she's by the tree. When you get to the park you realize you cant find her. There's other people there. There are trees and grass everywhere as far as the eye cans see. When you contact her, she says the same thing. 

So why couldn't you find her in the park? Was her answer too vague? Too simple? Too confusing? Did she give you enough information to find her in the first place? Was it the way she told you? The chances are, it was all of it. The communication between you and her was not good enough. It was also not clear at all where she was.

As software engineeers, we encounter problems all the time. If we want help, we need to be able communicate our issue in a way that others will understand, which is referred to as the "smart way". There is no need to question the "question". If we follow the proper guidelines, we will always get the help. Sometimes, they may already give you a solution. Let's look at two examples from  StackOverflow.

This first example comes from this link: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57895641/bootstrap-4-text-refuses-to-go-in-the-middle-of-a-div>.

This shows what happens when you don't ask the "smart way". The title of the post is "Bootstrap 4 - text refuses to go in the middle of a div". The first thing I noticed was the question. I wasn't sure what he was trying to ask in the first place and it looks plain lazy. The second thing is the description of his problem. It is very unorganized and confusing. It took me some to realze what he wanted to do. The last thing I noticed is the response. Only one person tried to help him and it didn't look like a promising response.

The second example comes from this link: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42283011/add-validation-to-a-mediatr-behavior-pipeline>

This shows a "smart way" of asking. The title of this post is "Add validation to a MediatR behavior pipeline?". Unlike the last post, the user is much more clear in describing the problem. First thing to note is the title. The question is gives us a clear image on what the problem is gonna deal with without even reading the post. Second, he describes his situation clearly. He tells us what he is using and what he wants to accomplish with it. He also provides code in such a well organized matter. Finally, the most important thing to note is the response he got. Because of how well the user was able to explain his situation, another person was able to give him a step-by-step solution to his problem.

From those two examples, you can clearly see impact of asking the "smart way". If we ask the right way, it is easier for others to understand what you want and what you need. Most of the time, someone else already has the answer to your problem and will give it to you. Asking the "smart way" also tells others the level of understanding we are at in the problem. That way they can walk you through it step-by-step. Finally, I learned that asking the "smart way" yields really good results. It solves problems, it makes you smarter, and makes you a better person.
