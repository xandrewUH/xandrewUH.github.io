## Struggles Of Learning a New Language

Did you ever want to learn a new language? Have you tried doing it? Do you know another language? If any of those questions apply to you then you've experienced the struggles. 

In the beginning you are faced with troubles learning some the basics. You can't memorize that simple object in japanese. You can't even pronounce those greetings correctly in Spanish. To learn even the simplest of things, it may take more time and effort to adapt. 

Then towards the end, you become more comfortable with the language. You're able to greet Russians more fluidly now. You understand the format of Egyptian hieroglyphs. After all your efforts you have acquired a new tool at your disposal.

## Javascript Is a Language

Learning Javascript is the same concept. It feels that when you have lots of programming experience, learning Javascript is an easy task. In fact, the online tutorials I did for Javascript felt so easy because there was so much similarities except it's faster. No need for long syntax and functions. No need for long and redundant functions. It feels like Javascript was designed for doing long lines of code in a short amount of time.

## My Experience with Javascript

For my first experience with Javascript learned quite a bit. At first, I struggled stuck because of the simplicity of the syntax and vague tutorials. Towards the end it felt easy, fun, and effective. I learned how to code efficiently and simplistically. I was even surprised that there were so many shortcuts I could work with.

Overall, I think Javascript is a really great language to learn, especially if you are learning to develop software applications like me. It's much more effective than most of the other languages because it efficient, simplistic, and effective.

Even more, ICS 314 gives us practice WODS. I feel that these were so valuable and effective. I have improved the quality of my code and how much time I spend, and the amount of effort by a mile. Most of all, it really tests your limits as a programmer. In the future, I look forward to what Software Engineering has to offer, whether it is from the practice WODS, the new languages, or whatever else it is.
