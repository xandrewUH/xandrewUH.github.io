## Abiding by the Rules

Abiding by the coding standard is a pain. Just like real in real life, no one wants to follow the rules all the time and can be very frustrating to follow sometimes. In addition, there ae benefts and consequences to these rules, like why your mom got mad at you when you stole the cookie in the jar.  

## Why is the Coding Standard the Best Standard?

I believe that the coding standard is the best standard. Having a coding standard does justice not just for yourself, but for others. I have two reasons why the coding standard is the best standard. First, it forces you to write nice code as opposed to normal code. Think of it like your car. No one likes a dirty car. You want it sparkling clean.  This is the same with coding. You want yoour code to look like art and be able to read it. Second, it's maks it easier to collaborate together as a team. If you were working with other programmers on the same project, you will find that you will keep sharing and adding things to it. It's far more better if everyone on the on the team is on the same page and doing the same things.

## My inpressions

As a programmer, IntelliJ is a great tool to work with because it forces me to abide by this standard. What I think is really amazing is the fact that my code looks like it came straight out of the art museum. The checkmarks it give are also very useful, especially when I am trying to fix my code. In conclusioon, I am very contempt with using IntelliJ and looking forward what kinds of code i write next.
