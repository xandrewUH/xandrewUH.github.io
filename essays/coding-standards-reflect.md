## Abiding by the Rules

Abiding by the coding standard is a pain. No one one wants to follow the rules all the time. So why follow them?  The reality is, we tend to think only about the consequences. We forget about the benefits and why we should appreciate it.

## Why is the Coding Standard the Best Standard?

I believe that the coding standard is the best standard. Having a coding standard does justice not just for yourself, but also for others. This if for two reasons. First, it forces you to write neat code as opposed to normal code. Think of it like your car. No one likes a dirty car. You want it sparkling clean.  This is the same with coding. You want your code to look majestic and readable. 

Second, it's makes it easier to collaborate together as a team. If you were partnering with other programmers on the same project, you will find that having consistency between everyone is far more manageable and effective

## My Impressions

As a programmer, IntelliJ is a great tool to work with because it forces me to abide by this standard. What I think is really amazing is the fact it keeps me and my code in check at all time. The check marks it supplies are also very useful, especially during debugging. In conclusion, I am very satisfied with using IntelliJ and looking forward to working with it in future.
