I remember as a kid getting my very first phone. It was a gray Nokia flip phone with an antenna attached to the top. The only real thing it could do well was make a call to a friend and that's it. There was no text messaging, no e-mails, no Siri, and much more. That was 15 years ago. 

It is now 2019 and the phone I have now is very different. I have an Apple iPhone X. It has a touch screen, text messaging function, a voice recorder, takes pictures, and many more. On top of that it also makes phone calls just that much easier. The point is that techhnology is changing. As we grew up the technology and things all around have grown with us becoming more innovative.

Software engineering really opens the door for me in this regard. Instead of watching things become more innovative, I get to take part and become the innovater. By becoming an innovater, I get to make technology better and more innovative. I get to grow as a person and make the future more exciting. That is literally why I think what makes software engineering very interesting to me. 

With software engineering, I expect a lot of great things. I hope to help everybody's lives easier with technology they have never seen before. I wish to solve problems that many struggle with.  I look forward to the people I meet and the experiences that will make me a better coder. Most of all, I look forward to innovating the future and having fun doing it.
